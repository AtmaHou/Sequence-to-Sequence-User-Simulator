# Sequence to Sequence User Simulator
## Introduction
    This is a implement of Layla's short paper of Interspeech 2016
    
    
    Mapper is not included, which makes the result much higher comparing to the paper's report.
## Requirements
    - Tensorflow
    - Keras
## Dataset
    DSTC2 dataset
